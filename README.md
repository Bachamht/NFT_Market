[![MIT License][license-shield]][license-url]

This is a project I used to practice solidity development, which contains a lot of key techniques in solidity development.

If you are a newbie, you can clone this repository to learn. 

If you find any bugs, feel free to pr.

Good luck, bro.



##   Key Features Overview

* Iterable mappable storage with O(1) complexity

* Using slots for reading and writing data

* Scalable Contracts (Transparent Agents)

* Offline authorization using signatures

* Implementing Whitelisting with Merkel Trees

* Using Multicall to Batch Execute Function Calls

* Based on uniswapV2, support any ERC20 Token to buy NFT.

  

## key techniques

##### *EIPs involved*

* ERC20, ERC721, EIP2612, EIP712



##### *Framework Usage*

* Use foundry to build, test, debug and deploy Solidity smart contracts and use its cheat codes to manipulate the state of the blockchain to simulate various scenarios



##### *Front-end Demonstration*

* Use ether.js to link wallets, invoke contracts, and display logs. But the front-end part of the code is currently very imperfectðŸ˜¥



##### *Data Query*

* Deploy sub graphs using the graph to allow developers to query contract event data.
